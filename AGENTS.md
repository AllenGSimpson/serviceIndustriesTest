This repository includes a folder named VanillaReferenceFiles. It mirrors the common,map_data, localization, and events directories from the base game so you can reference how vanilla Victoria 3 defines various mechanics. The snapshot provided here reflects patch 1.9.2 of the game. These files are for consultation only and should not be modified or used directly in the mod.

Use them to look up event structure, modifiers, or other gameplay data whenever you need examples of vanilla implementation.
